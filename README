This is Net::SSH::Perl. It contains implementations of
both the SSH1 and SSH2 protocols.

PREREQUISITES

Protocol 1

    * Math::GMP (1.04 or greater)
    * String::CRC32 (1.2 or greater)
    * Digest::MD5
    * IO::Socket
    * Crypt::IDEA

Protocol 2

    * CryptX (0.032 or greater)
    * Crypt::Curve25519 (0.05 or greater)
    * IO::Socket

It optionally requires Digest::BubbleBabble for
generating bubble babble fingerprints.

INSTALLATION

Net::SSH::Perl installation is relatively straightforward. If
your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do

    % perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::SSH::Perl'

If you don't like that, you can download the distribution; the
latest version on CPAN can be found at

	http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-SSH-Perl/

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

SAMPLES/TUTORIALS

Take a look at the scripts in eg/ for help and examples of
using Net::SSH::Perl.

* eg/cmd.pl is just a simple example of some of the
functionality in the module;

# eg/pssh is an ssh-like client for running commands on
remote servers and connecting to a shell on remote servers;

* eg/pscp is a very simple scp-like script;

* eg/pssh-keygen is, as you might guess, an implementation of
ssh-keygen in Perl, using the Net::SSH::Perl key libraries.
It contains almost all of the functionality in the OpenSSH
version of ssh-keygen.

* eg/remoteinteract.pl is an example of using register_handler
to interact with a remote (interactive) command.

Both pssh and pscp support a subset of the command line options
that the actual tools support; obviously, only those options
supported by Net::SSH::Perl are supported by the two scripts.
