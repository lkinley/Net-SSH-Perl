=head1 NAME

Crypt::OpenSSH::ChachaPoly - Wrapper for OpenSSH Chacha20 and Poly1305 crypto
functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Crypt::OpenSSH::ChachaPoly;
  my $c = Crypt::OpenSSH::ChachaPoly->new($key);
  # set up IV with 8 byte IV and little endian 8 byte counter
  $c->ivsetup($iv,$counter);
  my $enc = $c->encrypt($plaintext);
  # poly_key needs to be 32 bytes long
  # in openssh, poly key is derived from encrypting a 32 byte zero value
  # with chacha20 using the packet sequence number as IV and a NULL (undef) counter.
  my $tag = $c->poly1305($enc,$poly_key)
